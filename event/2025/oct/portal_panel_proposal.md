## 🪩 Context: Solana Foundation Event at Prospera  

**Submitted By:** Frontier Tower SF & DUNA Makerspace  
**Artizen Profile:** [Make.DIY on Artizen](https://artizen.fund/index/p/makediy?season=5)

This proposal outlines a landmark cross-chain panel at the Solana event in Prospera. It will feature a live connection between two “proto-portals”:  
- one at the **DUNA Makerspace (Solana)**,  
- and another at the **Frontier Tower Makerspace in San Francisco (Ethereum)**.

Drawing inspiration from the Dublin–NYC portal, this live link will symbolize the founding of a **cosmological communications system** — the Peace Arch Portal System (PAPS) — bridging both space and chain through the physical artefact known as the Peace Circle.

## 💡 Core Thesis

> Blockchain ecosystems often exist in digital siloes. The next era of coordination will be defined by *physical interoperability*: connecting sovereign, protocol-aligned communities through tangible, co-present spaces.  
>  
> This panel will *literally demonstrate* that vision — linking Roatán and San Francisco through the Peace Arch Portal System (PAPS), anchored by the Peace Circle.

## 🧩 Portal Keepsakes: “Stargate Miniatures & Makerspace Magic”

Attendees at both sites will receive **3D-printed portal keepsakes**, designed and fabricated in real-time by the DUNA and Frontier Makerspaces.  
These will serve as:
- tangible mementos of the portal’s first opening,  
- cross-chain collectibles, and  
- symbols of physical sovereignty in networked civilization.

Each piece will feature:
- engraved **Make.DIY glyphs**,  
- glowing resin inlays,  
- and a small circular frame echoing the Peace Circle motif.

## 🤖 Makerspace Innovation: 3D-Print Portal Projects & Board-Game Integration  

In addition to the PAPS jargon and physical portal ring (the Peace Circle), we’ve discovered a rich ecosystem of 3D-print portal projects suitable for makerspaces and tabletop game integration. These offer excellent creative hooks for our community and tie perfectly into the “portal as physical/digital bridge” theme. Below is a summary of key resources and how they map to our initiative:

- The project **Calling Portals** offers 3D-print portal rings designed to hold a smartphone that plays animated visuals. Example: the “Ruined Archway Portal – Phone Portal” STL for tabletop RPGs. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- One Reddit user commented:  
  > “Started printing a series of phone-animated portals for tabletop RPGs; … This one is free.” :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Another listing on Etsy: “Magic Portals | Smart Phone Portal | 3D Printed Terrain | Phone Charger | Night Light” describes a portal structure into which you insert your phone, turning it into a glowing, interactive display. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- A search engine aggregator yields thousands of “phone portal” printable 3D models. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- An academic paper on “hybrid board games” (fabrication-augmented) describes embedding tangible creation and destruction in board games via players’ fabrication of artifacts, pointing to strong synergy with our makerspace-portal model. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

### How this maps to our makerspace & web3 mechanics:
- We can print a Peace Circle ring or portal housing and embed a smartphone as the “gate display” — the smartphone becomes the animated portal surface (analogous to a digital screen bridging worlds).  
- Within the makerspace session (both DUNA and Frontier), attendees can **3D-print their own miniature portal rings**, customize with chain-branding (Solana / Ethereum) and incorporate them as swag.  
- For board-game or tabletop game activations: the portal ring + smartphone model means the phone is physically part of the gameboard mechanics — it can display visuals, receive web3 triggers (NFT unlocking, cross-chain handshake), or show live stream feed from the remote portal site.  
- This creates a layered experience: **physical object (portal ring) → embedded device (phone) → live cross-site feed / chain event**. It ties Maker-craft, digital chain narrative, and physical space together.  
- It also opens additional engagement: community prints, collaborative maker sessions, portal-design contests, interoperability between makerspaces (print at DUNA, ship to Frontier, etc.), and linking to our network of sub-ZEDEs (Solana node, Bitcoin Borough, ETH sub-ZEDE).  

**Summary:** The 3D-print portal projects validate and operationalise the idea of the Peace Circle as a maker-artifact with digital linkage. They are prime candidates for our makerspaces to adopt, adapt, and integrate into the PAPS demonstration.
