-----------------------------------------------------

### **1. Executive Summary**

This proposal outlines a landmark panel discussion for the Solana event at Prospera. It will feature a live, real-time connection between two "proto-portals": one at the **DUNA Makerspace (Solana)** and another at the **Frontier Makerspace in SF (Ethereum)**.

Drawing inspiration from the Dublin-NYC portal, this event will explore the future of bridging digital and physical realms, foster cross-chain collaboration, and culminate in the official announcement of the **Network State Portal Project**—a global initiative to build a network of sovereign, interconnected physical spaces.

**Visual Concepts:**

### **2. Panel Title**

> **Portals, Protocols, and People: Connecting the First Network States**

### **3. 💡 Core Thesis**

> While blockchain ecosystems often exist in digital siloes, the next wave of innovation will be in creating tangible, human-centric connections between them. Just as the Dublin-NYC portal created a sense of shared experience, we can use similar technology to link sovereign communities building on different protocols. This panel is not just a discussion; it is a *live demonstration* of a positive-sum, cross-chain future.

### **4. Portal Keepsakes: Stargate Miniatures & Makerspace Magic**

Imagine stepping into the world of **Stargate: SG-1**, where ancient portals shimmer with cosmic energy, ready to whisk explorers across the galaxy. Now, shrink that epicness down to a keychain, a desk ornament, or a collectible that you can hold in your hand—your own miniature portal to another world.

At our **Makerspaces**, we can **3D print these portal keepsakes**, giving you a tangible piece of interstellar adventure. Each piece can feature intricate glyphs, glowing inlays, and the iconic circular portal design—all customized with the **Make.DIY** logo so it’s uniquely yours. Whether it’s a gift, a conference swag, or a collectible for your desk, these mini Stargates are more than just trinkets—they’re conversation starters, symbols of curiosity, and proof that imagination has no bounds.

And here’s the best part: our 3D printers make it easy to iterate, letting you experiment with sizes, colors, and even little moving parts. Turn your love of sci-fi into a hands-on creation experience, and leave with a keepsake that’s as functional as it is iconic.

Your next portal adventure doesn’t need a spaceship—just a Makerspace and a little **Make.DIY magic**. 🌌✨
