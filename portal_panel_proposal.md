### **Proposal: A Cross-Chain Panel on Physical Portals and Network States**
**Event:** Solana Foundation Event at Prospera
**Submitted By:** Frontier Tower SF & DUNA Makerspace

---

#### **1. Executive Summary**

This proposal outlines a landmark panel discussion to be held at the Solana event in Prospera. The event will feature a live, real-time connection between two "proto-portals": one at the **DUNA Makerspace (Solana)** and another at the **Frontier Makerspace in SF (Ethereum)**. Drawing inspiration from the Dublin-NYC portal, this discussion will explore the future of bridging digital and physical realms, fostering cross-chain collaboration, and will culminate in the official announcement of the **Network State Portal Project**—a global initiative to build a network of sovereign, interconnected physical spaces.

#### **2. Panel Title**

**Portals, Protocols, and People: Connecting the First Network States**

#### **3. Core Thesis**

While blockchain ecosystems often exist in digital siloes, the next wave of innovation will be in creating tangible, human-centric connections between them. Just as the Dublin-NYC portal created a sense of shared experience, we can use similar technology to link sovereign communities building on different protocols. This panel is not just a discussion; it is a live demonstration of a positive-sum, cross-chain future.

#### **4. Panelists (Proposed)**

*   **Moderator:** A prominent journalist or thought leader in the web3 space.
*   **Frontier Tower SF Representative:** Speaking to the vision of physical spaces for digital communities and the Ethereum proto-portal.
*   **DUNA Makerspace Representative:** Speaking to the maker movement, the Solana ecosystem, and the Solana proto-portal.
*   **Special Guest:** A leading voice on digital sovereignty and The Network State concept, to provide philosophical context.

#### **5. Discussion Flow & Key Topics**

1.  **Introduction (5 mins):** The Cultural Impact of Physical Portals.
    *   Briefly touch on the Dublin-NYC portal as a cultural phenomenon.
    *   Pose the question: What if these portals connected not just cities, but sovereign digital communities?

2.  **The Live Connection (10 mins):** DUNA <> Frontier.
    *   Live video feed is activated between the Solana and Ethereum makerspaces.
    *   Panelists from each location introduce their space, their community, and the proto-portal they've built.
    *   Discussion on the significance of connecting the two largest smart contract platform communities in a physical way.

3.  **Protocols & People (15 mins):** Beyond Tribalism.
    *   Why is it important to build bridges between Solana, Ethereum, and other ecosystems?
    *   How can shared physical spaces foster collaboration on tech, culture, and governance?
    *   The role of makerspaces as neutral, creative grounds for innovation.

4.  **The Announcement (5 mins):** The Network State Portal Project.
    *   We will officially announce the formation of the **Network State Portal Project**.
    *   **Mission:** To create a global, decentralized network of physical portals connecting digital-first communities, DAOs, and network states.
    *   **Call to Action:** Invite other makerspaces, communities, and protocols to join the initiative.

5.  **Audience Q&A (10 mins)**

#### **6. Logistical Requirements**

*   A dedicated panel slot on the main stage at the Prospera event.
*   Technical support for a high-quality, low-latency video stream from the main stage to both the DUNA and Frontier makerspaces.
*   Large screens on stage to display the live feeds from both portals.
*   Coordination with A/V teams at all three locations.
